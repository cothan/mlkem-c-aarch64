CBMC proofs
===========

# Overview

This directory contains [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) proofs for the absence
of certain classes of undefined behaviour for parts of the C-code in MLKEM-C-AArch64.

Proofs are organized by functions, with the harnesses and proofs for each function
in a separate directory.

TODO: Provide more information about CBMC and the properties it proves

# Usage

To run all proofs, print a summary at the end and reflect overall
success/failure in the error code, use

```
KYBER_K={2,3,4} run-cbmc-proofs.py --summarize
```

If `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is set, the proof summary will be appended to it.

# Covered functions

The following functions are currently covered:

- `poly.c`: `poly_compress`
